# Chisel Module Generator

It is only once that the Chisel project has been set up that the real mess begins...
Maintaining a good and sound organisation can be time consuming.
That is why this small project has been created : generating multiple template files via a single command line !

#### Disclaimer
The code is not as clean and modular as it should be. Unfortunately, I have a Master thesis to work on. Consequently, for the time being, this project is to take as it is. A clean and sound version will arrive "soon".
